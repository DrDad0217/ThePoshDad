title: About me

---

I am both a Powershell/Automation enthusiast and a father of the most amazing baby girl in the world. While my career is still in it's infancy as I approach my seventh year, my want to learn and share my own discoveries and insight has pushed me to create this blog.

### My story

I started my career off sticking barcodes on user machines along with basic hardware installation, the more experience I got the more I wanted to start digging in to the wonderful and vast field of technology. After about two years as a computer support technician I was offered a promotion to be a fully fledged hardware technician with my own sites and users. Unfortunately after a few years in this position my job duties went from on-site installations and large deployments to fixing students chromebooks, I have no issues doing menial repetitive work *BUT* I wanted more than that in my career. After a few months of searching I landed a new job working for an MSP(Managed Service Provider) and this is really what sped up my learning curve. Working with a vast array of clients need various solutions to fit their needs pushes(forces) you to learn in rapid intervals. This is also where my relationship with Powershell started to flourish, after doing manual onboarding for new users day in and day out I wanted to find a way to automate the process. This was my first big project that really pushed me to research and continue trying every method I could find until I found the right fit. Since that first project I don't think a day has gone where I have found myself not using Powershell
