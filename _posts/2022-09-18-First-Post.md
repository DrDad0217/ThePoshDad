I would like to start this post off by introducing myself, my name is Tanner and I'm a father and Powershell enthusiast. My passion for both of these things in my life is what lead
me to use the name PoshDad. My goal for this blog is to create a library full of helpful resources not only for myself but the tech community as a whole. I also want to show the relatable struggles of learning and the joy of self improvement. I hope you join me on this journey and I also hope these articles bring true value to your career.

Thanks for reading,
PoshDad
